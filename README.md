# Stock Transaction Management System

This C++ project provides a simple yet powerful stock transaction management system. It includes classes for representing individual transactions and managing a transaction history. The code supports reading transaction data from a file, sorting transactions by date, and computing the Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) and Capital Gain or Loss (CGL).
